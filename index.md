## Ancestry, Family Mapping, and the Enayati-Uzetas


This is an ongoing project and will be updated as I continue to contact more family members, hear more stories, and learn about progress in family mapping science. Use the table of contents to orient yourself, or scroll through to see all currently available information.

### The Enayatis

Though many scattered in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution, my maternal line can be traced back to two highly populated Iranian cities – Tehran, the capital, and Shiraz, where locals tend to have darker skin than many other parts of Iran.

However, in part due to the reach of the Persian Empire, our ancestry is much more mixed and our family is much more widespread than we'd assumed. In the map below, the red points are where we'd known of large clusters of family. The blue points are an incomplete map of our ancestry.

#### Jaleh Enayati

**Sent from country to country in pursuit of her daughter, Jaleh's life began again in the United States, but not necessarily for the better.**

The one thing Maman kept reiterating was her love for Iran. Born in Tehran, she was the second oldest of five children. She remembers very little of her youth besides the major milestones – to her, life is clearly divided between her years in Iran and her years after leaving. She was educated and went to college, then straight to a job at the bank; she married a successful businessman and had two children – her life was comfortable, happy, and "perfect." So was Iran. 

>It was the best country in the world. People would come from everywhere to visit. People had money, had space. It was excellent.    

In the mid 1970s, she sent her son to study in America. Her daughter, 8 or 9 at the time, went to gifted school a small distance from their house - a school that became a target for anti-Shah protesters as the Revolution began to spark.  


>One day, they took her bus, flipped it over, and set it on fire. I knew she was in danger and [I needed] to get her out.  


So she sent her daughter, Mahnaz (affectionately abbreviated to Nawzie, after the Farsi word for cuddles), to Holland to stay with an aunt. Later, she followed, leaving her husband behind. From Holland, Maman traveled to Germany and sent her daughter to a school in Scotland. They continued this pattern for five years, bouncing from place to place, never together and always staying in temporary situations with distant family or friends. It was a weird limbo period; a long stretch of isolation for everybody in the family, spread out across three continents.

>As soon as I could, I took her to America.   

So ended the European intermission and began the second part of her life, which she views as a restart. She did everything over again: started in a tiny Los Angeles apartment with her daughter, attending college to learn English and sewing dresses at a local department store. She renamed her children, Andrew and Amanda instead of Hamid and Mahnaz, and did her best to adjust. 

>*Do you like America?*  
>No.   

When her husband came to Los Angeles two years later, it was without anything that had been a part of their lives in Tehran. He became Frank, not Fazlolah, and they became Americans, not loyal Iranian citizens. Many members of their family scattered West, across Europe, and about 30,000 Iranians moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s. Maman will not be able to visit Iran again, but she continues to preserve and enhance her memory of it constantly.
